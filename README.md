The code section has been completed

1. Revised the independent variable "pol_trust": 1-4, High=Trust.
2. Add OLS model tables incorporating control variables “age\gender\edu\soc_trust” to further validate H2.
3. Following the professor's advice, I removed complex large-scale model interactions and replaced them with the most representative cross-national comparison of "Camera" attitudes.
4. Conducted data visualization for H3.

# 06/01
Rename the variables:
1. support_camera -> support_video
2. support_email -> support_internet
3. support_phone -> support_convert
